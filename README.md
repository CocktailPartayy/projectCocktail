shit to fix
 - when user click on event, it will go to the url with it's special event key and show event specific details
 - in the specific event user can add in other users based on SOMTHING email?
 - ability to add recipe to event specific to event
 - showing differennt locations when you input the same address for different ingredients (we can just top 3
 
notes about routing incase i forgot the next day
Route as would in app component
in the actual drink component, search id is passed as a property in params, in urls, in match, use such property to remake axios call and go from there


left to do:
    - change our LCBO api call thing
    - get rid of duplicates in array
    - find out how to route to a certain component upon sign not (donnt remember the last component we were on)
    - when i typed hey in the search input the whole thing crashed cuz cannot read map of null, remember to set a ternary on that
